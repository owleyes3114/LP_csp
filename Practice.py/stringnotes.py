#What makes something a string?
    #  A collection of symbols held together by quetation marks. The only data type that lets ,us use letters ("") and (''). Doed not matter as long as the qutations are matching.  

    #examples: 
first_name=input("What is your first name:\n").title()
last_name=input("What is your first name:\n").title()
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name

print("welcome")

# strip=gets rid of any uneccesary spaces at begining or end of a string
#.upper=turns reponse into capital letters
#.lower=make respone lowercase
#the last command at the end of the string is what the prgram will go with

scentence= "The quick brown fox jumps oiver the lazy dog."

print("Welcome to my program,", name, "!")
